# Expense Tracker

The application has a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to add, edit, and delete expenses. Users can categorize their expenses, view them by category, and track their spending over time. Additionally, the project features a login and registration system that uses JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the expense data. Users can create, edit, and delete their own categories as well. We have also added two more features: a currency converter for managing expenses in different currencies, and a notification and alert system to keep users informed about important updates, such as approaching budget limits or due payments.

Hi, I'm Fatima Ahmad! ðŸ‘‹ I built this project along with my teammates Amna Zahid and Anas Khan.
